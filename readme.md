Yup. this is yet another fancy ass todo list - or at least it's a todo.. At it's current state, there's quite some way, before it grows up and matures into a handsome useful todo list.

**Are you high!?**
You might be asking yourself this very question - and no i'm not high.

**Well.. Then why the f.... are you adding yet another todo to the huge pile og todos?!**
I'm on a mission, that's why! I feel the urge to make something that will not only make my everyday life more pleasent - but hopefully a hole bunch of peoples life more pleasent. Adding and removing stuff to a todo is no a brainer. But keeping a todolist organised, up to date and in sync, with all the other fancy productivity tools we all have stacked in our 'productivity-wrist-belt', can at times be a bain in the butt.. No one enjoys pain.. especially in the butt. just saying.

**Soooo... What's the deal here? Tell me about the big picture**
I'm glad you asked. I actually painted a picture to illustrate how i've planed to change the world with my todo - but my dog ate it. The truth.
The whole idea here is to keep it simple. Make an interface that is simpel but at the same time flexible enough too integrate different apis. If you'd like to get a list of your Basecamp todos - adding an api should be easy.
In short - the big picture is to keep the core as simple as possible and add functionality through apis.

**Great idea!**
I know - Let's make this happen then!

## Curent sate
The whole concept is to keep it simple. The current state of the project is 'fuck it, just ship it'. In other words - nothing is final yet. The project is at it's earliest stage.
There are two types of items atm. `list` and `todo`. Adding a *list* will allow you to add *todo's* within the *list*. Adding custom types should be straight forward atm - simply define a `itemType`.

## Pipeline
There is still quite a long way to go, but let's just take one step at the time. There's a list of things that still need to be done.
* Consider if [Meteor](http://meteor.com) is the right choice - We are looking to create a small community here, now is the time to have your say!
* Offline first! There's no need to store all this crap in a database, by default. An offline first approach with an account option would be preferred. This will ease the use - and remove the signup step! Hurraaa
* Enable accounts for people wanting to go cross devices - which is like insane, right?
* Fix the markup/styles. They are at an fragile state atm.


## Reaching out
